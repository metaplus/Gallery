Video player software project for 360-degreee omnidirectional video, supporting Virtual Reality with immersive surrounding experience. The project is developed based on Unity gaming engine :video_game: and certain extended functionality is implemented in native plugin, which is the main part that manipulates underlying resources. Currently, ultra high definition (4k/8k) equirectangular video :clapper: stored locally is able to playback and development on network streaming service is ongoing. Future target consists of realizing state-of-the-art tiling-based adaptive video streaming, signifying paralleled media streaming sessions, as well as truncated pyramid projection video rendering, proposed from Facebook.

## Experience Overview
Equirectangular video is re-projected back to the original spherical format and user :person_with_blond_hair: observes proportional region within Field-Of-View. If head mounted displays (e.g. HTC Vive :crown:) available, virtual world arises at the present.
